                    <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    Dusk beckons the weary back to their nests, but a few stragglers ignore its call and set on their
                    final task for the week.  I lead them to a dimly lit table where they take their places. With no
                    short intent, we begin, and those blessed to still expel breath past their shivering vocal cords
                    attempt to solve my murder.
                    <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    My damned soul seeks redemption by aiding the investigation, and I attempt to establish
                    communication through the cardboard thin barrier that separates myself from a dimension I occupied
                    still shallow in the past. A knocking can be heard, rattling the air about the investigators. They
                    sit unfazed by my apparition’s grasp into their world. But they do not let it go unanswered. With
                    stoic precision, they begin the rituals to prepare themselves for the trials ahead. Detectives
                    Stephen and Chris lay out the ground work for communication with the other side. Private
                    Investigator Lawrence levels his eyes to his phone, his fingers make their final dire movements
                    across the screen before he’s forced to join in.
                    <br> <br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    But there is little time for distractions. A link between worlds forms as quick as the secrets of
                    darkness, and I cast illusions of the past. Investigator by investigator they receive colourful
                    visions from the spirit realm. The visions wild, unclear, and each contrasting the last lead each of
                    the three consummate heroes down a different path. At first, they are cast visions of detestable men
                    and women, each with sinister motives, all capable of striking me down with apathy. The never humble
                    investigators quickly zero in on their targets. And yet. None with the correct man. I protest with a
                    series of knocks shaking the table between the investigators. Detective Stephen is forced into
                    action. He knows the team cannot afford wasting hours on trivial conjecture. He holds up one hand
                    and brings it down, index finger out-stretched towards the chair I had enjoyed most during my stay
                    amongst the living, with a conviction in his voice bribing every ear for its attention, he berates
                    me as worthless, doltish, and nonsensical. This assurance that the blame will fall squarely on me
                    should the clues be deemed insufficient for the sterling team invigorates them, and grins work their
                    way around each face that can be seen.
                    <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    The scraping of a clock without working gears pushes the investigation forward. Images flood the
                    minds of the room’s living inhabitants. This time several investigators find their suspect and begin
                    the art of re-creating the crime scene.
                    <br><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    “Where was he killed?”
                    <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    “With what?”
                    <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    “Why does he show me water when he wasn’t killed by the pool?!?”
                    <br><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    They ask and the answers come again in the form of visions. The hours continue to pass and the
                    investigators remain undeterred by clues, logic, or reverence for the dead in their goal to
                    castigate my increasingly tortured spirit. My strength deteriorates, and as I feel the final hour of
                    my link with their world approach, each of the investigators reveals they have a suspect, a crime
                    scene, and a murder weapon…
                    <br><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    Not a single damn match.
                    <br><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    Oh, the malevolent dealings of the spirit world and the tricks they play! The damned, with limited
                    ways of entertaining themselves in this purgatory, have lead two of the investigators down the wrong
                    path. With little time, I can give only one final vision, and then pray for salvation. The
                    investigators lean forward and accept the final card fate will deal them this night. They dream the
                    final dream unknowing which of the clues my spirit planted in it.
                    <br><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    The investigators deliberate.
                    <br><br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    The most cautious of the investigators Lawrence produces his ballot first. The devils of another
                    realm had played him perfectly, and persuaded him to vote for one who did not bear my blood on their
                    hands. Chris reveals his choice next, having gained valuable insight from the final clue, he bares
                    the symbol of my executioner. With the deciding vote, the decision that will impact the corporeal
                    and ethereal worlds, lead investigator Stephen, promoted by his efficiency, presents the token of
                    the suspect that will be deemed guilty by the group. He presents the symbol “3”. Another innocent
                    (in this case) suspect accused and by virtue of Stephen’s rank found guilty. As my soul’s final link
                    to the world of the living burns away in a crackle, I hear one final message skip across the
                    intangible embers…
                    <br><br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
                    “Wait. I thought my guy was 3, I was voting same as Chris”

                Notes:
                <br><br>
                I had fun with this one just describing a game of Mysterium with friends but leaving the reader with
                clues rather than stating it was just a board game.
                <br>
                Experiments here were based on setting tone and mood. Tried out the nonsense metaphor and also had to
                contain all the text within a short word limit.
