                    The sun broke the walls of the pit, but even that wouldn’t slow down Sally Smithson, the world’s
                    youngest archeologist, from uncovering the City of Dinosaurs. Sheathed in dirt and sweat, she releases
                    a Velociraptor skeleton from the soil’s grasp, along with the prehistoric spear it used in hunts.
                    Everyone would celebrate her struggle, proving to be the next breakthrough in dinosaur sentience.
                    She merrily scrapes away more dirt, as the bright light above is interrupted by a shadow…

                    Obnoxious emergency lights eclipse the morning sun. My left-hand twists unable to shade my eyes from
                    it all. I tread towards an unassuming suburban house. A young officer I don’t recognize holds the
                    door as I shield my shoes in plastic. I navigate up too many stairs to the last place the girl was
                    seen. The empty bedroom lays fixed in time, clothes litter the mud-stained carpet, sand lines a soft
                    imprint in the bed. The room was well lived-in, but not in the state I’d want to find my son’s
                    bedroom. The windows, while clouded, lack scratch marks. My only thought, as my superintendent crept
                    into the room with the girl’s mother, was that the girl could have been coaxed out by someone she
                    knew, but this was the third such occurrence within the week and there was no obvious link with the
                    other children.
                    <br><br>
                    “Mrs. Smithson, I’d like you to meet - ”
                    <br><br>
                    “Hello, Mrs. Smithson,” I extend my hand towards the woman. She lightly takes it and releases,
                    before crossing her arms and leaning away. I fail to catch her wide eyes,
                    “I only have a couple of questions.”
                    <br><br>
                    She nods.
                    <br><br>
                    “Does Sally have a cellphone? Or was she in contact with anyone yesterday?” I pry.
                    <br><br>
                    She bends her gaze even further from my face and her head sways.
                    <br><br>
                    “What was Sally doing the day she disappeared?”
                    <br><br>
                    She pauses, stretching her jaw to locate her tongue. “I told them, the other officers. She was just
                    digging in the backyard and we had dinner and she just went to bed early.” Another pause.
                    “I checked on her. She was asleep. She- Everything was fine before I went to bed...”
                    And her voice trails off. Her face teeters, before she turns away from me completely.
                    I hear the scraping of air against mucus as she coasts out of the room.
                    <br><br>
                    My super flashes a flattened face at me before following her.
                    <br><br>
                    I stroll through the backyard before leaving. A mess of toys and shovels surround a sandpit, backing
                    the mother’s claim. A high fence prevents any line of sight to the sandbox, apart from a neighbour’s
                    back porch. I shrug it off, the neighbour isn’t shared with the other cases.
                    <br><br>
                    Our small town is now taking the alerts seriously. News outlets interrupt whatever train of stories
                    their bias decided was “newsworthy”, and scare parents into actually being involved. The activity in
                    the streets and parks fades earlier than usual, but the lights of homes are brighter and last deeper
                    into the night than ever.
                    <br><br>
                    Sitting at the dinner table I watch my son swell on about a dream, but I’m unable to grasp the
                    delicate details. Eventually he begins to stutter and deflect his eyes, waking me to how fixated on
                    him I was. I let the pumping of my heart drain the fog inside of me before attempting to respond.
                    “That’s interesting. Don’t worry about dishes tonight. I’ll take care of them.”
                    <br><br>
                    “Okay”
                    <br><br>
                    My son gently shuffles himself away from the table; he dances off to his room. My eyes rest on his
                    path, as my mind goes back to work anatomizing the morning’s crime scene.
                    <br><br>
                    I sit there, My mind pulses, but I cannot retrieve a complete thought. The more I struggle to
                    understand the disappearances the tighter my skull feels, I let my left index finger dig at it
                    through my temple. A rough scratching brings my attention back to reality of my home, Likely just
                    the sound of my upstairs neighbours, but I’ve already cast my eyes. The light that was peeking from
                    under my son’s door had vanished some number of minutes ago. I rise and slowly drift towards my
                    son’s room. I can smell the pine door as I fix the brisk doorknob into my palm. I hold my breath
                    and listen. Stillness. I rotate my wrist carefully and shift my weight into the door. Behind me.
                    My heart and lungs seize in unison as the loud buzz breaks the silence. I flail my right arm back.
                    And then. A prolonged inhale fills me, and my stomach glows. I pull my phone out from my back pocket
                    to check the message. Another crime scene. My eyes rise to my son sporting a mile-wide grin in his
                    slumber. I hope this isn’t long.

                    The stadium is brimming with spectators, but Max Pietrov can only see his mother, playing with her
                    hands while stealing glances at the track. Max turns his head to watch the rest of his classmates
                    take their position. The million-dollar prize would make this the paramount race of 5th grade. The
                    starter pistol blasts and Max missiles down his lane advancing the runners. He steals a glance at
                    his mother, leaning forward in her seat, before he loses her in the leaping crowd; they cheer his
                    name, as he breaks the ribbon. His mother’s eyes sparkling with tears grant him another look at her.
                    He struggles to inhale through grinning teeth, and his legs keep running, running from something…

                    Cruiser front lamps slicing the darkness hail me, and I slip into their blind spot. My face is met
                    with an invasion of heavy droplets as I swing open the car door. The rupture of each drop against
                    the pavement screams into the night. I tug my coat up to my ears for protection, then release once
                    inside the house.
                    <br><br>
                    “The Feds made it to this one,” my super asserts as I enter. I trace the tip of his nose to a
                    formally dressed pair. They pluck something from the carpet and bag it; I let them finish before
                    moving in. The woman has short, ginger hair and a hardened face. The man is clean shaven, and has
                    a pair of deep-set eyes. He is the one who attends my approach.
                    <br><br>
                    “You’re my lead?” He asks buntly.
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah, I’m handling the missing kids.”
                    <br><br>
                    “You’re working under us now, come.”
                    <br><br>
                    I walk with them to a main floor bedroom. Contrasting the last crime scene, this room is pristine,
                    ready to display to our midnight crew, with one exception. The agents motion for me to start talking
                    them through what I see. I point out the sand and untouched window as links, beyond the rooms
                    lacking their child. The agents handle the sample and dig at my mind for more. I finish
                    disappointing them, more quickly than they had hoped, and excuse myself into the night.
                    <br><br>
                    Intercepted before I can reach my car. My first thought is some idiot reporter prowling for an
                    inside quote, but the wrinkled clothing and hit-or-miss style of shaving hint that neither of the
                    men in front of me could hold a studio job. My body shifts into cruise; I keep my speed, dig my
                    hands deep into my pockets, and fix my eyes on the ground two strides ahead. I allow a boisterous
                    exhale out my nose as I pass between the men. The tension begins to leave my face as I reach my car
                    in silence, but then, I make the mistake of looking back for the men as I draw open the door.
                    <br><br>
                    “Was there sand?”
                    <br><br>
                    One of the men has his head bowing as the words tremble out. The shorter man watches.
                    I interrupt before he repeats himself. “Why?”
                    <br><br>
                    “We think it’s, like, well…” His words trip and fall before completing a thought. “It’s
                    happened before, he brings them dreams, takes their bodies, and leaves nothing but sand.”
                    <br><br>
                    “Who?” I question, obliging ‘sand’ to draw me into his ramblings.
                    <br><br>
                    The shorter man grips his mate’s shoulder before an answer is let out. The taller one looks to his
                    friend then back to me. “Was there sand?”
                    <br><br>
                    I nod, then listen as they nervously scrape together a tale of six abductions, fifty years ago, in a
                    town just across the state line. I knew of the case, but the man convicted had died behind bars; at
                    most we had a copy-cat culprit. They repeat something about dreams, but eventually the
                    inconsistencies and leaps of these two men just peeve my already exhausted mind. I mutter “thanks”
                    halfway through a sentence, before getting in my car to drive home.
                    <br><br>
                    I spend the next day in recovery from the previous night. My encounter with the two odd men begins
                    to pervade my thoughts, ridiculous as it was. I attempt to eject it with the mindless cartoon my son
                    had chosen for the evening. He leans into my side as we watch together. And inside the spastic glare
                    of the box, I relax.
                    <br><br>
                    Five nights, five missing children, our small town is exhausting its supply. I ponder if my son’s
                    value has risen, but a chill vibrates my upper spine and I snap back to the reality of another crime
                    scene. In the rising sun, I watch the agents rake the scene, and observe everything they find
                    suitable for a forensics lab. I relieve their search by suggesting we meet the parents.
                    <br><br>
                    The female agent leads the couple through a string of questions, during which her hand never ceases
                    its movement across a small bound notebook. Her partner stands with me, removed from the
                    conversation, but his eyes are piercing them, making a note of each tremble. Both parents lean on
                    each other for balance, and neither manages more than a short gasp of air. Still, I am impressed by
                    the robust answers.
                    <br><br>
                    “Did he talk about dreams in the last five days?” I inject. Four faces lock onto mine.
                    <br><br>
                    “I thi- Yes,” says the boy’s father. “Lately, he just, likes to talk about them.”
                    <br><br>
                    As soon as we dismiss the parents, I can feel the piercing eyes on me. I turn to meet the
                    short-haired woman’s question.
                    <br><br>
                    “Why dreams?”
                    <br><br>
                    “S-Something I uh I guess I heard…” I stammer then pause, but they wait me out. I explain the
                    previous night, knowing with no other leads stories of mysterious men with interest in the case
                    should have already been shared. I don’t see the agents blink once as they question me, but I suck
                    in some air and meet each question with a calm professional answer until they are satisfied.
                    <br><br>
                    “Every detail of this case comes straight to us.” The woman scolds concluding their questions.
                    <br><br>
                    “Yeah, I got it.” I retreat from the scene with nothing else I can say at this point.
                    <br><br>
                    The next break would be that afternoon. I drop by my son’s school hoping to surprise him with a
                    ride home.
                    <br><br>
                    As I sit in the parking lot, I happen to glance up at a van stopping in the alleyway across the
                    street. I watch as our two mystery men hop out and open the van’s back end. They are rapidly shoving
                    supplies into a backpack. A knock on my door takes my attention, I turn to see young kids spilling
                    from all ends of the school, my son looks at me from the other side of the passenger door, he must
                    have spotted my car. I unlock the door and watch him climb onto the seat next to me. “Wait here a
                    moment,” I say as I carefully get out of the car and walk towards the van.
                    <br><br>
                    The taller man was now carrying the backpack down the sidewalk while his friend lead the way
                    stalking a group of young boys. When one of the boys breaks off from the group towards a small
                    house the two men stop and wait for the boy to disappear inside. I duck behind a fence before they
                    do a quick scan and head onto the property. Peeking over the fence I see them creep around the house
                    taking discreet looks into the windows until they settle on one, and begin pulling small hand
                    tools from the backpack.
                    <br><br>
                    Now I had to make my move, I call the FBI agents, and move in on my targets. As I got close, I could
                    make out a small webcam and transmitter that they were mounting. These perverts were making videos
                    of children. As they spotted me both men raised their hands in surrender. I gave them some orders to
                    turn around and they complied without a word. Within a minute both were seated on the grass in
                    handcuffs.
                    <br><br>
                    Having the predators in custody was one part of the battle, but the clock was ticking if we could
                    still help the taken children.
                    <br><br>
                    I question the men, what were they doing, where were the children. But neither makes a sound. The
                    FBI agents would be here soon, and I wouldn’t get another chance to talk to the men afterwards. I
                    decide exercise my curiosity. “Why do they dream?”
                    <br><br>
                    That gets the attention of both men. They fidget to look at each other.
                    <br><br>
                    “2-4-0-3 Lanchester Road”
                    <br><br>
                    That was enough for me. When the agents show up they are able to take the men without issue. I head
                    back to my car and see my son wearing a bit of a scowl having to have waited twenty minutes. I take
                    him to the drive-through for a treat before dropping him off at home. I had somewhere to check out.
                    <br><br>
                    Twilight reigns, I cautiously approach the front door, not underestimating these idiots’ capacity to
                    set a trap. I knock on the door, then press my ear to it faintly hearing a patterned whisper,
                    whatever is inside is not nearing. I enter through a large window, an eternal murmur leads me to a
                    basement door, where the scent of compost leaks out. I open the door and I’m set upon by a cold
                    gust, as I creep down the steps the edge of my skin begins to burn, I can just make out the large
                    fans and air conditioner units that make the air frigid as a meat-locker, my joints complain, but I
                    concentrate. The soft light of machines scarcely dents the darkness, so I pull out my phone and use
                    its glow to scan each step, praying this isn’t how I find the children. I stop before a shelf of
                    electrical equipment, the receivers and recording devices all still running, above them disc cases
                    each labelled with an address and a date. I sift for addresses of a disappearance but instead pull
                    down a case with my address, dated yesterday night, a creak from the other end of the house makes
                    the hair on my neck leap, I shut my phone off and listen, but I can’t hear anything over the fans.
                    I settle on another buried light further into the basement, and silently trek towards it. A monitor
                    sits on a desk connected to a DVD player, I take a seat and put my movie in, the light off the
                    screen draws all the attention, and as my son’s room appears, I feel a target on my back like a
                    large heavy lump and attempt to steady my breathing. I hold my breathe as my son takes the stage
                    and undresses for bed, I watch him climb into his bed and drift off, I let the video run for a
                    while, but as I reach to shut it off the shadows begin to move, something is growing, and suddenly,
                    there’s a person in the middle of the room, standing over my son. It moves an arm into a satchel on
                    its back hip, then using that hand, covers my son’s eyes. It stays. Watching him for at least five
                    minutes, then begins to dissolve. The sensation in my back is making it impossible to sit. I need
                    to leave. I need to get to my son.

                    The boy recognizes the alternative tune from the stereo. He enjoys the song but has been avoiding
                    it, it was the last he heard with his mother before… But his mother was there, swinging with the
                    rhythm of the song. The scent of lemon spray she uses on everything mixes with the aroma of French
                    toast. His father is hard to recognize as he enters, the hard lines work had imprinted on his face
                    are missing and his steps are lighter as he walks over to the boy’s mother and greets her with a
                    short kiss. The boy rushes forward to his parents, he reaches out for them, and his arms are too
                    short. No. They are being pulled back…

                I burst into my home. The air is placid. Quiet.
                <br><br>
                I feel my way through the kitchen. No time to find a light switch. I stumble down the hall. My shoulder
                connects with a door. I rip it open.
                <br><br>
                Overwhelming.
                <br><br>
                My son. Asleep. Evaporating into sand.
                <br><br>
                This being. Standing over him. Taking him from me.
                <br><br>
                Its eyes glare in my direction, suppressing every muscle in my legs. I can hardly stand. Only watch.
                The demon before me is barely visible in the shadowed room. He’s not solid, rays of fading streetlight
                pass through his body. My son’s body mimics the sound of an hourglass as dry beads rise from him. They
                spin into the monster’s bag like the formation of a black hole. I can only watch. I see its face, no
                mouth, no expression, just a gaze. That gaze never leaves me even as it disintegrates, and vanishes into
                the night. I’m left behind with only a small amount of sand where my son lay.

                Notes:
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, I lost the final copy of this story somewhere just updating it into the website I already
                found several errors which needed to be corrected (likely many I didn't see).
                <br>
                I think the style of story where mystery gets mixed with fantasy fits my writing style; but there are
                many things I need to improve on to make this a good story. The set-up happens a bit fast certain parts
                are over-narrated while others don't get flushed out. It was good to experiment with paragraph length
                to meet the pace of action vs the tightening of tension and I think that's most of what I took away from
                writing this piece.
